# Web Application Exercise

A little exercise to build a web application following an agile development process. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Product vision statement

The app simplifies group payments by enabling vendors to process one shared bill while customers easily split expenses and pay only for what they consumed.

## User stories

1. As a vendor, I want to receive all customers’ split payments at once so that I don’t have to handle multiple cards or checks at the same time.
2. As a vendor, I want to create a list of customers’ orders with their corresponding prices so that I can easily create bills.
3. As a vendor, I want to prevent manual entry of payment on the vendor side so that incorrect charges caused by human error can be avoided in advance.
4. As a vendor, I want customers to make payments directly from their table so that they don’t have to wait for a payment terminal or staff assistance.
5. As a vendor, I want to see real-time payment status and progress so that I can confirm when the bill is fully paid.
6. As a customer, I want to create a group with my friends so that we can easily and quickly split the bill even for a large party.
7. As a customer, I want the system to automatically calculate my share based on the items I ordered and shared so that I only pay for what I actually consumed.
8. As a customer, I want to process my payment directly to the vendor so that I don’t need to manually settle up, double-check amounts, or chase friends for reimbursement.
9. As a customer, I want to register my payment method once in advance so that I don’t have to carry my physical card every time.
